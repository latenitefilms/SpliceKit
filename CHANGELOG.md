## [3.2.07] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **HEVC MP4s tagged `hev1` now import into Final Cut.** Apple's
  AVFoundation / QuickTime / Final Cut decoder only accepts HEVC when the
  MP4 sample-entry is `hvc1` (parameter sets in extradata); files muxed
  with `hev1` — including most Dolby Vision iTunes rips — played in VLC
  but showed up as unimportable in FCP. The hook extension filter now
  covers `.mp4`/`.m4v`/`.mov` alongside the Matroska family, detects the
  `hev1` tag via AVURLAsset's codec FourCC, and retags the file for
  Final Cut.
- **Zero-duplication fast path for large HEVC retags.** A full
  stream-copy remux of a 19 GB DV rip would have to write out another
  19 GB (and needs the headroom to do it). Instead we use APFS
  `clonefile()` to make an instant COW snapshot, `mmap` the tail 64 MB
  of the clone (where the moov box sits on non-faststart MP4s), find
  the `hev1` sample-entry by its box-size prefix, and overwrite 2 bytes
  in place (`e`→`v`, `v`→`c`). Total extra disk: a single modified
  block (~KB). Total runtime: a few seconds. The original file on disk
  is untouched — only the clone is modified.

## [3.2.06] — 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- **MKV shadow-remux now handles h264, hevc, av1, prores** (and mpeg4 /
  mpeg2video) — the previous pass only covered VP9/VP8, so typical WEB-DL
  releases (h264 + E-AC3 + subrip) failed to import. Audio is handled
  independently: aac/mp3/ac3/eac3/alac/pcm stream-copy, everything else
  transcodes to AAC 192k stereo so the shadow MP4 is guaranteed playable.
- **HEVC Main-10 10-bit MKVs are now decoded in FCP.** Apple's
  AVFoundation/FCP only accepts HEVC with the `hvc1` sample-entry tag;
  ffmpeg defaults to `hev1` from Matroska input, which plays in VLC but
  refuses to open in Final Cut. We force `-tag:v hvc1` on HEVC sources.
- **Subtitle / attachment streams no longer break the remux.** Explicit
  `-map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0?` replaces `-map 0`, so subrip subtitles (two per
  episode on most WEB releases) and font attachments are dropped instead
  of failing the MP4 mux.
- **B-frame display order survives the CFR timestamp rewrite.** New
  `setts` expression rewrites DTS to a clean `N·frameTicks` grid while
  preserving each packet's source PTS–DTS offset (snapped to whole
  frame-durations). VP9/VP8 behaviour is unchanged (offset term collapses
  to 0); h264/hevc/av1 now keep their B-frame reordering instead of all
  frames collapsing to `pts==dts`.
- **Media Import "Processing files for import…" no longer stalls.** The
  hook short-circuits for any non-`.mkv`/`.webm`/`.mka`/`.mk3d`
  extension (previously it ran ffprobe on every file in the tree — a
  `~/Movies/` with Motion Templates and JDownloader sub-folders meant
  thousands of pointless probes) and uses a deterministic
  `basename.<hash>.mp4` shadow path so re-entering the hook for the same
  source (3–5× per Media Import row) hits the existing shadow instead of
  respawning ffmpeg.

### Changed
- **Menu renamed from "Enhancements" to "Splices"** in Final Cut's menu
  bar. The Debug menu-bar dropdown is no longer installed — the Debug
  prefs pane still rebuilds, just doesn't clutter the menu bar.

## [3.2.05] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **MKV / WebM imports.** Drop .mkv or .webm files onto Final Cut and SpliceKit
  generates a shadow MP4 remux on the fly. FCP sees a native container; the
  original file stays untouched on disk.
- **Highest Quality toggle for URL imports.** New checkbox in the
  "Import URL to Library" / "Import URL to Timeline" dialog (and a
  `highest_quality` parameter on the MCP `import_url` tool) fetches the highest
  available resolution from YouTube / Vimeo — 1080p, 1440p, or 4K via VP9 / AV1
  — instead of YouTube's 720p progressive-mp4 cap. Leave it off for the fast
  720p path.
- **Share Logs** button in the Patcher status panel — one-click upload of the
  latest Final Cut Pro crash log plus SpliceKit logs to filebin.net, with the
  link copied to the clipboard.

### Fixed
- **URL import FCPXML parse failure** when the downloaded filename contained
  ampersands or other XML-reserved characters (e.g. a YouTube title containing
  "PS5 & PS5 Pro"). `NSURL.absoluteString` leaves `&` literal in file URLs; we
  now XML-escape the `src=` URL before it lands in the generated FCPXML, so
  `FFXMLTranslationTask` accepts it.
- **URL import progress HUD.** Finer-grained updates (~5× more frequent), the
  live percent is embedded in the status text, and the duplicate
  "Downloading YouTube media… 100.0% 72%" readout is gone. Spinner now stays
  vertically centered against the label whether it wraps to one line or two.
- **LiveCam** mask kernel dispatch and shader-coordinate fix resolves
  subject-lift / green-screen edge artifacts on some machines.
- **BRAW** settings inspector locks to a dark appearance to match FCP's other
  inspectors.

### Developer / Setup
- `.mcp.json` now points at the `mcp-setup` venv interpreter, so Claude Desktop
  MCP works without hand-editing Python paths.
- MCP `import_url` tool gained `highest_quality: bool = False` for programmatic
  access to the new quality toggle.
